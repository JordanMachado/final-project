Unity Project
===================


Unity is an interactive learning experience.

Intended to children from the youngest age, it aims to promote mutual assistance between children by revisiting the school program through collaborative games.

Through this application, which is played on a touch table, children embark on an intergalactic adventure in which they fly their own rocket to explore different planets of the universe.

Each planet represents a chapter of the school program, adapted in different games.

These games are designed so that they canâ€™t succeed alone. In this way, to advance in the adventure, children are encouraged to collaborate.

This device allows them to gather together once a week and throughout the year, around the table to work together irrespective of levels and promote exchange within the class.
